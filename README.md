* **Hibernate/JPA**: Data persistence and object-relational mapping.
* **MySQL**: Relational database.

**Frontend**:

* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Building the user interface.
* **Fetch API**: Asynchronous communication with the backend.

**Docker**:

* **MySQL database container**, configured via Docker Compose.

**Git**:
