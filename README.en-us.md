## How to Run the Project

**Assumptions:**
- You are using JDK 21
- You are using CMD or PowerShell as your terminal
- You have MySQL running locally
- Git commands are added to your PATH

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 3. Run the Backend

Package the application as an executable JAR:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

### 4. Run it in a New Window

After packaging, execute:

```powershell
start "SnowmanApp" cmd /k java -jar target\Snowman-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > output.log
```

### 5. Open the Frontend

Open the file `frontend/index.html` in your browser or use a local server.
